# Minimalist Personal Website

## Introduction

This personal website project – conceived with stark minimalism in mind – was built entirely with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). Various social media profiles as well as some secret links serve as the starting point to my presence on the Internet. The randomly placed "beach ball" (famous for its alter ego as the macOS waiting indicator) adds a playful element to the site. Try hovering over it – pretty neat, huh?

## How to get stared

To get started, you first need to make sure that you have the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en) installed. If you haven't, please do so before continuing. With these tools set up, you can go ahead and install the necessary packages by calling this command from the root directory:

    yarn install

After all the packages are installed, you are ready to start the application. Simply call this command from the root directory in order to compile your code for development (why yes, hot reload is included):

    yarn run serve

If you want to get the project ready for production (i.e. compile and minify it), call this command from the root directory:

    yarn run build

Last but not least, make sure the [Linter](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/tree/dev/packages/%40vue/cli-plugin-eslint) is happy with you by calling the following command from the root directory (if applicable, fixing is included for free):

    yarn run lint

That's about it. Happy hacking!
